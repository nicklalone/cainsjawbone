#page1: Narrator discusses wanting to write something. So they are an author. #amsterdam Mentions #sea, mention #valetudianarianwalrus #StLazarus-in-the-Chine: what is this? It seems to be a church but is also mentioned in the same paragraph as martyrdom. The #question I have coming out of this page is if the narrator is staying with the #casyferris family? #question: is #casyferris's dad dead? If so, how? when? why? Why is the narrator thinking of him so often?

#page2: The narrator is reading? Why are they coming back home to #london? Who is this #woman? There is an author who died. Could this be #casyferris's dad? Or, is it the #page1 narrator? 

#page3: #clement, #assassin, #pill, 3 names associated with a #publishing_firm. Less than a week until someone is killed ( #justice ).

#page4: Piled abomination? The queen? Old man walking in the puddles and wants to talk to Annie. Another purpose? Henry was accused of a crime? A little boy is playing and might tumble into the sea, perhaps already has?

#page5: #henry #evelynhope dead? Noticed things the narrator didn't care about. #thomashardy is walking around with letters. #bisto is a gravy. #cerebos is salt. Drinking on top of a lighthouse and narrator seems to be powdering their nose? Cocaine? Snuff? Henry seems to be stating a story to the narrator. 

#page6: I considered that venerable whose winter Achilles thought to take from the lips of
Cressida. - Greek myth about a woman from Troy who fell in love with an officer from greece but the father demanded otherwise. "she would not have to change the initials on her parti-panties." - a clue about the identity of the person speaking in this book. Gardening metaphors. Foxgloves. Fire symbolism. Speckled Band - Holmes reference. Most of this page is devoted to thinking about how a woman would react if the narrator made up his mind about her.

#page7: Narrator had reread a Joseph Conrad novel called Typhoon. "Charles-Victor Hugo was the son of the poet Victor-Marie Hugo. Charles-Victor became an editor, and was jailed in 1851 for writing an article on the death penalty. When Louis-Napoleon seized power in 1851, Victor-Marie's republican beliefs drove him into exile, first to Brussels and then to the island of Jersey, where Charles-Victor joined him in voluntary exile." = https://www.nga.gov/collection/artist-info.17717.html. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firth_of_Forth it is a river in Scotland. Who would believe not Sherlock Holmes? Jew's Lime: Pitch, asphault, etc. Renard-Beinsky: I, Charles Victor Hugo Renard-Beinsky, half Pole, half Frenchman, drunken mongrel, lazy waster, and the rest of it â€” I am a Christian! Rather a damaged specimen, but I am one of Christ's Christians according  to the gospel of St. Tolstoi. 

#page8: Investigator's perspective. Is this the same narrator as the other pages? Investigating a dead body with a magnifying glass. Is this the person from #page1? Is the thing they need to write the results of the investigation or is this a reference to a Watson type figure? What is this quote referencing? "I measured the distance carefully with my eye : a good forty inches, I made it." Need to figure out who Mr. Hall is, what the knobby thing was that was black and red.

#page9: There is a person sitting somewhere who seems to be an investigator of some sort. They hear someone ringing on the doorbell to their house. However, the person at the door seems to be partially mistrusted by the narrator. The investigator who seems to be the narrator had an assistant named #charlesday. The narrator seems to have given lectures on minerology at a university called Peebles University. Charles Day filled in for the narrator for a 2 week period (fortnight). So basically, someone is ringing the doorbell and then the narrator is thinking about it, their past as a military commander, etc. 

#page10: On this page, the narrator is discussing a bet between 2 people. The man will get cigarettes if he wins. The woman will get 3 pairs of etam dawn mist? There is a #bet between a man and a woman. It seems to be coming to a head on Hyacinth's Day which may be a reference to May 6th? Also to Jasmine's day. "She drooped long seed pearl things right over the soup. Ear-drops, as my mother had called them, I never could abide ; probably because I belonged to the other side of the family. My mistress wore them ; was it for that that I had begun to tire of her already?" - Is the narrator tired of his mistress? If so, who is it?
