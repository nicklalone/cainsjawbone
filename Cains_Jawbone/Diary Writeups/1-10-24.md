Started in on Cain's Jawbone today. I had a few assumptions before I began. The assumptions were this: 

1. I'd be able to suss things out quickly.
2. Since this is timeless, it'll have very few needs to look up slang or knowledge from that time period. 
3. Each page would be useful.

By the end of page 1, all of these assumptions were out the window. I mean you have the following: 

1. Page 1: Alliteration via Walt Whitman, metaphors about martyrdom, and a whole bunch of people I have no idea about. 
2. Page 2: Someone is reading something and lamenting over the deaths of someone. There's a lot of metaphors here again.
3. Page 3: Someone buys some sort of tool but seems to be indicating something like 11 miles of something? 
4. Page 4: A page about forlorn love, perhaps a kid dying, and a few drunks.
5. Page 5: Lighthouses, more drugs, and all sorts of folks. 

I left this initial session with an idea of just how difficult this thing was going to be. At the end of the session, I basically had a whole bunch of notes that could be summarized as, ????
